🎯 Project Objective
Our project simulates a comprehensive loan management system using regression-based machine learning techniques. The application predicts default amounts based on historical borrower data, helping financial institutions assess loan risks more effectively and make informed lending decisions.

By leveraging advanced ML algorithms and statistical analysis, we aim to demonstrate how data science can revolutionize traditional financial risk assessment processes.
